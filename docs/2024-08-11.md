Always start `tmux` script:

```bash
if command -v tmux &> /dev/null && [ -n "$PS1" ] && [[ ! "$TERM" =~ screen ]] && [[ ! "$TERM" =~ tmux ]] && [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
  tmux a -t default || exec tmux new -s default && exit;

# Pointers

- A pointer is just an address to a piece of data in memory
  - Ex: 32-bit computer, sees 32 1s and 0s as a unit, 64-bit computer, sees 64 1s and 0s as a unit.
  - Address in a 32-bit computer is a number between 0 -> 2^32 ... ~4 billion memory addresses
  - Address in a 64-bit computer is a number between 0 -> 2^64 ...~Really really big
- A "memory address" is just a number in that range



- `&` - get the address of the variable
  - when you do this, the address becomes "some pointer type"
- `*` - it depends on which side it is being used
  - 'L' side (left side) for declarations such as `int *x = 3`, we are saying that `3` is a memory address assigned to `x` which is a "pointer to an integer"
    - BUT! If `*` is on the `L` side without type declaration such as `*z = 78`, it means to modify the value located at the address of `z` to `78`.
  - 'R' side (right side) such as `int y = *x`, means we are taking the value stored at the pointer (address of) `x`, meaning at location `3` and assigning it to `y`. For example, location `3` could be containing the value `1500`. So `y` has `1500`.
    - When * is on the `R` side, you can't just take the value of any variable. The variable has to be a "pointer type" - therefore something like `int z = *y` won't work because `y` is an `int` type not a `int *`.
